            // between variables and how you output it.

            // PART 1
            // Declare a variable that contains your name.
            // Declare a variable that presents yourself, referencing the variable above: "Hi, my name is (my name)".
            // Think about how you name the variables.
            // Write the presentation to the Console.

            // PART 2
            // Declare a variable with the name of a movie you want to see at the cinema.
            // Declare a variable containing whether the movie is a Danish movie.
            // Declare a variable containing the estimated price for the movie ticket.
            // Declare a variable containing the estimated price for a beverage.
            // Declare a variable containing the estimated price for popcorn.
            // Declare a variable containing the total cost of going to see the movie.
            // Write to the console: the name of the movie, whether it is Danish and the total estimated cost of your visit.

            // PART 3
            // Let's pretend that your estimates above are an average for everyone in the audience.
            // Declare a variable containing the estimated number of seats in the movie theater showing the picture.
            // Declare a variable containing the expected average ratio of seats taken during a screening. (Example: 0.75 = 75% of seats sold on average)
            // Declare a variable containing the expected number of seats sold for this screening.
            // Declare a variable containing the expected cost for the cinema to do a single screening.
            // Declare a variable containing the total revenue of this screening for the cinema.
            // Present the calculation and results in the Console. Put some energy into formatting, so it is easy to read and understand.

            // PART 4
            // Update the value of the expected cost for the cinema (not by changing it above, but by re-assigning it below this line).
            // Output the value of the expected revenue again (below this line).
